&nbsp;I've been through a lot. I'm putting it out there like that, because I don't know how else to describe it. I've been abused, abandoned, adopted, a high school dropout and homeless. I was born to two parents who didn't know how to take care of children. My birth mother was neglectful,too concerned about her own agenda in life than to being a good mother. She left my sisters and myself home alone. I was 5, they were 2 and 1. She expected me to watch them while she went out. My father on the other hand was physically abusive. So much so that I stayed overnight at the hospital when I was 3 years old with welts and bruises on my body. Between the combination of the two, my sisters and I were placed in foster care; we were separated. When I was 7, I was in my second foster home; I loved it there. They were kind and they treated me like a human being, not something I was used to. Their 20 year old son seemed nice, he'd always let me play his video games, he'd shoot hoops with me, he just seemed like the big brother I never had. On a few occasions, he'd take me to his room and tell me to do things I didn't know were wrong at the time. One of the times, he did something that made me feel uneasy and he hurt me, even as a seven year old I knew something was wrong. I told my foster parents and they called the police. I was taken from that home that very day, and placed into another home. I began seeing a therapist and taking to someone people about what happened. It all made me feel uncomfortable and weird. The new home I was placed in already had a large family; I liked it. They were kind, supportive of my past and they seemed very geniune, I felt like I was a part of their family. They even found my sisters and brought them along as well. Things were good. So good that they wanted to adopt my sisters and I. A year later, me and my sisters gained a family, we were officially a part of something that no one could take away. For the first few of years things were good. I don't think I have ever been happier in my entire life. That all changed once I turned 13 and my mom got really sick. She changed, my dad changed along with her. Gone was the kind, sweet lady, and in was the verbally and physically abusive one. It was like someone flipped a switch and she became someone new. She along with my dad began drinking, they'd come home and pull us out of bed to yell and scream at us. She began telling me that I was worthless, I wouldn't amount to anything, called me a nigger, that no girl would ever want me, I wasn't college material, she'd search my room, my bookbag and anything I owned. She would poke fun at my writing, and anything personal I had, she tore it to shreds. She would pull my hair, spit on me, kick me, slap me and once she shoved my head in a toliet; told me I was a piece of shit. My dad, was physically abusive, he would tell me how stupid I was, but what really hurt was being tossed around and punched. As the years rolled by the abuse got worse. I watched as my sisters endured some of the same verbal lashings that I did. I couldn't stop it and to this day it still eats at me. I would go to school with marks and bruises, a few of my friends or classmates would ask me what happened, I lied. I told them a cat scratched me or that I got in a fight with my brother. I felt horrible I couldn't tell anyone. This was still better than foster care. It got so bad I ran away from Maryland and took a bus to Colorado when I was 16. I stayed with complete strangers and I offically dropped out of high school, just to get away from them. After a month, I was forced to go back. This continued until I was 18 and I was ready to leave, I didn't have any resources and no place to stay. I was kicked out by my dad after getting a cell phone from the mall and refusing to return it. He was in the right this time, but I was so fed up with being treated the way I was that I rebelled for the first time. I told him no. He took my suit case of belongings and tossed them out side, grabbed me by my neck and told me to get the fuck out. I had no place to go and I had no idea what to do. After I called and texted a few friends, I scrounged up enough money to head to Texas. I had no idea that homelessness and starting over with nothing was the life that waited me at 18 years old. 
<br><br>
Long story short, I eventually got my GED, I got my own place, I enrolled in community college and now I'm set to attend Texas Tech University on a full scholarship the next two years. It wasn't easy, I worked my tail off and I made so many mistakes and failed along the way, I kept moving and I never gave up. I share my story because I know what it feels like to want to give up, to feel hopeless, to be abused and abandoned. I hope if anyone reads this that they never give up. I'm here for you, I'm just a message away. <h5>Keep moving forward.</h5>
