&nbsp;My birth parents were two people who were too young, too messed up and were unfit to be parents. Ever since I was a child I had always had a soft spot for my birth parents, they put my life on a dangerous crash course with failure, but I somehow still remembered all the little things about them that favored them in positive light. I didn’t remember my mother leaving my two younger sisters and myself home alone at the ages of 18 months, 2 years old and 4 years old to fend for ourselves. I don’t remember my father beating me to the point where I spent the night at the hospital at 3 years old. I don’t remember all of those bad things they did, because I was far too young to remember that, or maybe I just blocked it out mentally, but I thank god I don’t remember those things. It wasn’t until later on when I was mature enough to realize what they had done, that I began to resent them. In fact, I began to blame them for anything bad that was happening in my life. They were the blame for why I was in foster care, they were the blame for me being sexually abused while I was in foster care, they were the blame for why I was so messed up inside. Obviously that’s not the way to go about things, but I was an angry little kid who didn’t understand the concepts of these things. All I knew was that parents were supposed to protect me, and they didn’t. I would go to school and see parents picking up their kids. I was confused as to why I couldn’t have that. What did I do wrong?
    <br><br>
My personality shifted and completely changed. I recently learned that I was a very outgoing personable kid. I would walk up to strangers and hug them and strike up conversations with them. I was able to walk up to other kids and almost instantly make a new friend. That kid I described was the person I used to be. I don’t know at what point I changed, but I became the total opposite of that by the second grade. I became disruptive, I isolated myself from my classmates, I would do things simply to get punished seemingly. I began shy, I was afraid to approach other kids in class and I had no real friends. I was constantly in trouble and was suspended on numerous occasions.
<br><br>
After bouncing around three different foster homes, I finally was placed in a foster home I liked. They were nice, they fed me the same food that their biological children received which was a new thing for me. They didn’t yell at me when I asked to play with toys that weren't mine. I even got my own room, I was used to sharing a room with a bunch of other other foster children. For the first time in distant memory, I felt liked. I felt spoiled. I didn't feel like a burden, like a nuisance or like they hated me. This was different, but this was nice. They didn’t yell at me for my behavior at school, they would ground me, but they didn’t yell at me. Why are they being so nice to me? I didn’t realize they weren’t simply being nice to me, this is how parents are supposed to treat children, I wasn’t used to this.
<br><br>&nbsp;
Eventually I began seeing a child therapist and psychiatrist, I was given the help I needed. It was during these sessions I realized I had sisters. During the madness of my birth parents doing what they did, the state split my sisters and I apart. Courtney and Tai stayed together and were placed in a group home, I was taken away and placed in a foster home. I never had contact with them during that period of time, I didn’t even know I had sisters. So to put it lightly, it came as a surprise when they would ask me questions about them. I don’t remember my emotions of how I felt hearing that news, but I remember coming home after a session and nearly begging my then foster parents to adopt us all. I told them that I would even pay for their college. This was a seven year old, telling grown ups they he’d pay for his sisters college, I can only imagine how asuming that was to witness. I just wanted us all together, they were what was left of my family and I wanted a family. I never expected them to say yes, but they did, a year later, I became a part of a family. No more foster care, no more lonely nights wondering if my birth mom would ever come back for me, no more uncertainty. This is what I wanted. I was happy.</p>
